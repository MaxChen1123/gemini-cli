# gemini-cli

`gemini-cli` is a simple yet versatile command-line interface for Google's
Gemini LLMs, written in Go. It includes tools for chatting with these models and
generating / comparing embeddings, with powerful SQLite storage and analysis
capabilities.

## Installing

Install `gemini-cli` on your machine with:

```
$ go install github.com/eliben/gemini-cli@latest
```

You can then invoke `gemini-cli help` to verify it's properly installed and
found.

## Usage

All `gemini-cli` invocations require an API key for https://ai.google.dev/ to be
provided, either via the `--key` flag or an environment variable called
`GEMINI_API_KEY`. You can visit that page to obtain a key - there's a generous
free tier!

From here on, all examples assume the environment variable was set earlier to a
valid key.

`gemini-cli` has a nested tree of subcommands to perform various tasks. You can
always run `gemini-cli help <command> [subcommand]...` to get usage; e.g.
`gemini-cli help chat` or `gemini-cli help embed similar`. The printed help
information will describe every subcommand and its flags.

This guide will discuss some of the more common use cases.

### Models

The list of Gemini models supported by the backend is available on [this
page](https://ai.google.dev/models/gemini). You can run `gemini-cli models` to
ask the tool to print a list of model names it's familiar with. These are the
names you can pass in with the `--model` flag (see the default model name by
running `gemini-cli help`), and you can always omit the `models/` prefix.

### `prompt` - single prompts

The `prompt` command allows one to send queries consisting of text or images to
the LLM. This is a single-shot interaction; the LLM will have no memory of
previous prompts (see the `chat` command for with-memory interactions).

```
$ gemini-cli prompt <prompt or '-'>... [flags]
```

The prompt can be provided as a sequence of parts, each one a command-line
argument.

The arguments are sent as a sequence to the model in the order provided.
If `--system` is provided, it's prepended to the other arguments. An argument
can be some quoted text, a name of an image file on the local filesystem or
a URL pointing directly to an image file online. A special argument with
the value `-` instructs the tool to read this prompt part from standard input.
It can only appear once in a single invocation.

Some examples:

```
# Simple single prompt
$ gemini-cli prompt "why is the sky blue?"

# Multi-modal prompt with image file. Note that we have to ask for a
# vision-capable model explicitly
$ gemini-cli prompt --model gemini-pro-vision "describe this image:" test/datafiles/puppies.png
```

### `chat` - in-terminal chat with a model

Running `gemini-cli chat` starts an interactive terminal chat with a model. You
write prompts following the `>` character and the model prints its replies. In
this mode, the model has a memory of your previous prompts and its own replies
(within the model's context length limit). Example:

```
$ gemini-cli chat
Chatting with gemini-1.5-flash
Type 'exit' or 'quit' to exit
> name 3 dog breeds
1. Golden Retriever
2. Labrador Retriever
3. German Shepherd
> which of these is the heaviest?
German Shepherd

German Shepherds are typically the heaviest of the three breeds, with males
[...]
> and which are considered best for kids?
**Golden Retrievers** and **Labrador Retrievers** are both considered excellent
[...]
> 
```

During the chat, it's possible to ask `gemini-cli` to load a file's contents
to the model instead of sending a textual message; Do this with the
`$load <path>` command, pointing to an existing file.

### `counttok` - counting tokens

We can ask the Gemini API to count the number of tokens in a given prompt or
list of prompts. `gemini-cli` supports this with the `counttok` command.
Examples:

```
$ gemini-cli counttok "why is the sky blue?"

$ cat textfile.txt | gemini-cli counttok -
```

### Embeddings

Some of `gemini-cli`'s most advanced capabilities are in interacting with
Gemini's embedding models. `gemini-cli` uses SQLite to store embeddings for a
potentially large number of inputs and query these embeddings for similarity.
This is all done through subcommands of the `embed` command.

#### `embed content` - embedding a single piece of content

Useful for kicking the tires of embeddings, this subcommand embeds a single
prompt taken from the command-line or a file, and prints out its embedding in
various formats (controlled with the `--format` flag). Examples:

```
$ gemini-cli embed content "why is the sky blue?"

$ cat textfile.txt | gemini-cli embed content -
```

#### `embed db` - embedding multiple contents, storing results in a DB

`embed db` is a swiss-army knife subcommand for embedding multiple pieces of
text and storing the results in a SQLite DB. It supports different kinds of
inputs: a textual table, the file system or the DB itself.

All variations of `embed db` take the path of a DB file to use as output. If the
file exists, it's expected to be a valid SQLite DB; otherwise, a new DB is
created in that path. `gemini-cli` will store the results of embedding
calculations in this DB in the `embeddings` table (this name can be configured
with the `--table` flag), with this SQL schema:

```
id TEXT PRIMARY KEY
embedding BLOB
```

The `id` is taken from the input, based on its type. We'll go through the
different variants of input next.

**Filesystem input**: when passed the `--files` or `--files-list` flag,
`gemini-cli` takes inputs as files from the filesystem. Each file is one input:
its path is the ID, and its contents are passed to the embedding model.

With `--files`, the flag value is a comma-separated pair of
`<root directory>,<glob pattern>`; the root directory is walked recursively
and every file matching the glob pattern is included in the input. For example:

```
$ gemini-cli embed db out.db --files somedir,*.txt
```

Embeds every `.txt` file found in `somedir` or any of its sub-directories. The
ID for each file will be its path starting with `somedir/`.

With `--files-list`, the flag value is a comma-separated pair of filenames. Each
name becomes an ID and the file's contents are passed to the embedding model.
This can be useful for more sophisticated patterns that are difficult to express
using a simple glob; for example, using [pss](https://github.com/eliben/pss/)
and the `paste` command, this embeds any file that looks like a C++ file (i.e.
ending with `.h`, `.hpp`, `.cpp`, `.cxx` and so on) in the current directory:

```
$ gemini-cli embed db out-db --files-list $(pss -f --cpp | paste -sd,)
```

**SQLite DB input**: when passed the `--sql` flag, `gemini-cli` takes inputs
from the SQLite DB itself, or any other SQLite DB file. The flag value is a SQL
`select` statement that should select at least two columns; the first one will
be taken as the ID, and the others are concatenated to become the value passed
to the embedding model.

For example, if `out.db` already has a table named `docs` with the column names
`id` and `content`, this call will embed the contents of each row and place the
output in the `embeddings` table:

```
$ gemini-cli embed db out.db --sql "select id, content from docs"
```

With the `--attach` flag, we can also ask `gemini-cli` to read inputs from other
SQLite DB files. For example:

```
$ gemini-cli embed db out.db --attach inp,input.db --sql "select id, content from inp.docs"
```

Will read the inputs from `input.db` and write embedding outputs to `out.db`.

**Tabular input**: without additional flags, `gemini-cli` will expect a filename
or `-` following the output DB name. This file (or data piped from standard
input in case of `-`) is expected to be in either CSV, TSV (tab-separated
values), JSON or [JSONLines](https://jsonlines.org/) format and include a list
of records that has an ID field and some arbitrary number of other fields that
are all concatenated to create the content for the record. The content is
embedded and the result is associated with the ID in the output SQLite DB.

For example:

```
$ cat input.csv
id,name,age
3,luci,23
4,merene,29
5,pat,52
$ cat input.csv | gemini-cli embed db out.db -
```

Will embed each record from the input file and create 3 rows in the `embeddings`
table associated with the IDs 3, 4 and 5. In this mode, `gemini-cli`
auto-detects the format of the file passed into it without relying on its
extension (note that it's unaware of the extension when the input is piped
through standard input).

**Other flags**: `embed db` has some additional flags that affect its behavior
for all input modes. Run `gemini help embed db` details.

#### `embed similar` - finding similar items from an embeddings table

Once an `embeddings` table was computed with `embed db`, we can use the `embed
similar` command to find values that are most similar (in terms of distance in
embedding vector space) to some content. For example:

```
$ gemini-cli embed similar out.db somefile.txt
```

Will embed the contents of `somefile.txt`, then compare its embedding vector
with the embeddings stored in the `embeddings` table of `out.db`, and print out
the 5 closest entries (this number can be controlled with the `--topk` flag).

By default, `embed similar` will emit the ID of the similar entry and the
similarity score for each record. The `--show` flag can be used to control which
columns from the DB are printed out.

### `template` - generate a text prompt from your own preset templates

If you always pass some fixed format prompts like "what is the difference between __ and __?" or "explain __ in 3 sentences", `template` can help you generate those prompts in a convenient way.

Use `--add string` flag to indicate that you want to add the argument as a template, and take `string` as the key to find it. The template, if you plan to insert some text into it later, should have one or more placeholders `%s`. There are some examples:
```
$ gemini-cli template --add diff "what is the difference between %s and %s?"
```
or 
```
$ gemini-cli t -a tsl "translate the following sentence into %s: %s"
```

The `--list` can be used to list all the templates you have added.
```
$ gemini-cli template --list

diff    :what is the difference between %s and %s?
tsl     :translate the following sentence into %s: %s
```

`--use key` is to utilize the template, the text arguments you've passed will be inserted in place of the placeholders in the template, and the filepath or the url will be passed just as in the `prompt` command.   
```
$ gemini-cli template --use diff "こんにちは" "おはよう"

Both こんにちは (konnichiwa) and おはよう (ohayou) are Japanese greetings, but they differ in the time of day they are used:

* **こんにちは (konnichiwa)** is used **from noon to evening**. It translates to "good afternoon" or "hello" in English. 
* **おはようございます (ohayou gozaimasu)** is used **from morning until noon**. It translates to "good morning" in English.
[...]
```
```
$ gemini-cli t en 我不喜欢吃香菜,太难闻了 -u tsl

I don't like cilantro. It smells too strong. 
```

Once you have configured the template combination that suits you, the `template` command will become very convenient.
